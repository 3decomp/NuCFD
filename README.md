`NuCFD`, for Non-uniform Compact Finite Differences, is a library implementing compact finite
difference schemes on non-uniform grids.

## Building

The `NuCFD` build system is generated by `cmake`, a default configuration can be created by running
``
cmake -B build
``
from the root directory.
Once the build system has been generated running
``
make -C build
``
will build the library.
The build can be configured using the `ccmake` tool, however currently only `gfortran` is supported.

## Testing

After building the library it can be tested using `ctest`.
From the root directory run
``
make -C build test
``
to launch the tests.
If any test fail more detailed output can be shown by running `ctest` verbosely
``
cd build
ctest --verbose
``
which will print any output from the tests, add `--rerun-failed` to only repeat failing tests.

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated using the FORD tool by running
``
make -C build/ doc
``
